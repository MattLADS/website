You'll use type signatures to declare the types of functions and variables.\n\n3. **Expression Evaluation:** Haskell programs are evaluated by applying functions to values. This means the order of operations is defined by the nesting of function calls.\n\n4. **Pattern Matching:** This is a powerful technique for defining functions and handling different cases based on the structure of input data.\n\n5. **Recursion:** Haskell commonly uses recursion to solve problems. This involves defining functions that call themselves with modified inputs.\n\nTo write a basic program, you'll need to:\n\n1. **Define functions:** You'll create functions using the `::` operator to declare their type signatures and the `=` sign to define their bodies. \n\n2. **Input and Output:**  Haskell provides functions like `read` and `print` for working with input and output.\n\n3. **Main Function:** The `main` function is the starting point of your program.

This helps ensure your code works correctly. Type signatures look like this:\n\n   ```haskell\n   functionName :: inputType -> outputType \n   ```\n\n   This tells Haskell that `functionName` takes an input of type `inputType` and produces an output of type `outputType`.\n\n2. **Function Definitions:**  Functions are defined using the `=` sign, with the input on the left side and the output (or calculation) on the right side.\n\n   ```haskell\n   addOne :: Int -> Int\n   addOne x = x + 1 \n   ```\n\n   This function `addOne` takes an integer `x` and returns the integer `x + 1`.\n\n3. **Pattern Matching:**  Haskell uses pattern matching to handle different cases within functions.

Inassignment 2, you are going to build on this assignment to create an externalDSL that others can use to create images without any Haskell knowledge.You are going to re-use your implementation of some of the functions in`Graphics.hs` from assignment 1 (note that colors and points in this assignmentuse `Double` rather than `Float`, however your implementation should not need tochange).  You only need to edit the files in the `src/` directory, I will ignorechanges to any other files when grading your assignment.## Directory structureThis is the Stack directory structure we will use in programming assignments:- `src/` directory contains the actual implementation (the library code).  *This  is where all of your code will go for this assignment*.- `app/` directory contains the programs that use the library. We don't have it  in this assignment, because the assignment consists of only implementing some  library functions. We will have it later when implementing full programs like  an interpreter.- `test/` directory contains the test code.  Your grade will be based on how  many tests your program passes.  Each module in `src/` directory has a  corresponding module in the `test/` directory specifying what that module is  ought to do.

Make sure you understand how your color representation and color operations will work with `Double` values this time. \n\n3. **Higher-Order Functions:**  The assignment emphasizes higher-order functions.  Think about functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. Common examples include `map`, `filter`, and `fold`.  These are essential tools for working with functional data structures.\n\n4. **Domain-Specific Language (DSL):** This is the fun part!  You'll be building a little language that makes it easier for someone to create images without needing to write Haskell code. Think about the basic operations you'll want to include, such as creating shapes, applying colors, combining images, and so on. \n\n**Some Tips:**\n\n* Start by implementing the basic functions for colors, points, and images, focusing on the core operations you'll need for your DSL. \n* Think carefully about the types you use for your data structures.  The type signatures will guide you toward a well-designed library.\n* Gradually build your DSL, starting with simple operations and adding more complex ones as you go.\n* Break down your program into smaller, manageable functions.  This will make your code easier to understand and test.\n\nGood luck with this assignment!

They specify the structure of the values.\n\n\nExample (without specific code):\n\n```haskell\n-- Define a data type for points with x and y coordinates\ndata Point = Point Double Double deriving (Show)\n\n-- Define a data type for colors with red, green, and blue components\ndata Color = Color Double Double Double deriving (Show)\n\n-- Example of creating a point:\nmyPoint :: Point\nmyPoint = Point 1.0 2.0\n```\n\nThis example defines `Point` and `Color` data types.\n\nKey Considerations:\n\n* **`deriving (Show)`:**  This is very common and allows you to easily print values of your custom types using `print` or `putStrLn` functions.\n\nFocus on understanding these fundamental elements: `data`, type constructors, data constructors.

		genai.Text("output: To define a function in Java, you use the `static` keyword (for methods that belong to the class) or you can create an instance of a class to call a method of that instance. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **`static` keyword (for class methods):**\n   - Use the `static` keyword in the method signature. This indicates the method belongs to the class itself, not to any specific object of the class.\n\n   ```java\n   class MyClass {\n       public static int myFunction(int input) {\n           // Function logic goes here\n           return result;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Method Definition:**\n   - `public` or `private`: Modifiers controlling access to the function.\n   - `return_type`:  The type of data the function will produce (e.g., `int`, `String`, `boolean`).  If the function doesn't return anything, use `void`.\n   - `function_name`: A descriptive name for your function, following Java naming conventions.\n   - `parameters`: If the function takes any input, list the parameters (and their types) in parentheses.\n\n   ```java\n   class MyClass {\n       public static int add(int a, int b) {\n           return a + b;\n       }\n\n   //Another Example of non static method \n       public int multiply(int a, int b) {\n           return a * b;\n       }\n\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Function Body:** This is where you write the code to perform the function's actions.  Remember to declare `variables` inside the function scope (with proper types). Finally, use the `return` keyword to send a value back from the function if the return type is not `void`.\n\nRemember, in Java, functions are called methods.

		genai.Text("input:A question from a student trying to learn how to program something. what are classes in java?"),
		genai.Text("output: Classes in Java are blueprints for creating objects.  They define the structure and behavior of objects. Think of a class as a template for a specific type of thing.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n* **Structure:** A class defines the *data* (variables, attributes) and the *methods* (functions) that operate on that data.  Think of the data as the characteristics of the object, and the methods as the actions it can perform.\n\n* **Objects:** Objects are instances of a class.  They have their own, unique data values based on the class.  You create multiple objects from the same class, each with their own set of data.\n\n* **Encapsulation:**  Java classes often encapsulate data and methods, which means the data is hidden and accessed through methods. This protects the data and makes the class more maintainable.  Think of this as a secure container holding the object's data, and methods are the only way to interact with it.\n\n* **Inheritance:** Classes can inherit properties from other classes (superclasses or parent classes), creating a hierarchical structure. This allows for code reuse and organization.  Imagine a class for `Animal`, and `Dog` inherits from `Animal`.\n\n* **Polymorphism:**  Objects of different classes can sometimes be treated as objects of a common class (superclass), allowing flexibility in how your code interacts with them. This is like having multiple types of `shapes` and being able to treat them all the same in a generic function.\n\n* **Abstraction:** This is about simplifying the complex behavior of an object.  You expose only the necessary details and hide the underlying implementation.  Imagine a `RemoteControl` object.  You interact with the buttons, but don't need to know how the TV is actually receiving the commands.\n\n* **Example (without specific code):**  Imagine a `Car` class. It might have attributes like `color`, `model`, and `speed`.  It might have methods like `accelerate`, `brake`, and `honk`.  You can then create multiple `Car` objects, each with different colors and models, and use the methods to interact with them.\n\nBy understanding classes, you can structure your Java programs in a well-organized way, promoting code reuse, and facilitating more complex applications."),

Functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc` return memory addresses, which you store in pointers.  This allows you to create and manage data structures whose size isn't known beforehand.\n\n\n2. **Modifying Data Indirectly:**  Using pointers, you can pass the address of a variable to a function, enabling the function to modify the original variable directly.  This is useful when you need a function to change the value of a variable in the calling function.\n\n\n3. **Passing Large Structures Efficiently:**  Passing large data structures (like arrays or complex objects) by value can be inefficient.  Passing pointers instead reduces the amount of data copied, making it faster and saving memory.\n\n\n4. **Implementing Data Structures:**  Many data structures, like linked lists, trees, and graphs, rely on pointers.

The size of this block is specified by the programmer.\n\n2. **`size_t`:** The argument to `malloc` is of type `size_t`.

This makes the code visually appealing and easier to read.  Tools like linters (especially language-specific ones) help enforce this.\n\n5. **Documentation:** Document your code with detailed descriptions of its purpose, usage, and functionality.  This is especially helpful for larger projects and when other people might need to use your code.\n\n6. **Version Control:** Use a version control system (like Git) to track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your program.\n\n7. **Testing:** Write tests to verify that your code functions correctly. This helps catch errors early on and ensures that your code continues to work as expected when making changes.

It's a powerful tool for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Base Case:** Every recursive function must have a *base case*.  This is a condition that stops the function from calling itself further.  Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. Think of it as the stopping condition for the function's repeated calls.\n\n2. **Recursive Step:**  This is where the function calls itself with a modified input.  The input should be closer to the base case in each recursive call.  Imagine climbing a staircase: each step takes you closer to the top (the base case).\n\n3. **Working Back Up:** The function uses the results from recursive calls to calculate the final output.  This \"working back up\" part often involves combining or manipulating the results returned by the smaller subproblems.\n\nExample (conceptual - not executable code):\n\n```\nfunction myRecursiveFunction(input) {\n  // Base case: if input meets a certain condition, stop recursing\n  if (input is base case) {\n    return some_value;\n  } else {\n    // Recursive step: call the function again with a modified input\n    result = myRecursiveFunction(modified_input);\n    // Combine the result from the recursive call with something\n    return combined_result;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n*   **Iteration vs. Recursion:**  Recursion and iteration (loops) can often solve the same problems.

Too many calls can lead to a stack overflow.\n*   **Correctness:**  Careful consideration of base cases and the recursive step is critical to avoid infinite recursion and ensure the correct results.\n\nWhen using recursion, focus on:\n\n- Identifying the base case (the stopping condition).\n- Creating the recursive step that modifies the input and moves it towards the base case.\n- Understanding how the results of the recursive calls will be combined or manipulated to produce the final output.\n\nConsider whether recursion is the most efficient approach for the specific problem you're trying to solve.

Adding checks for validity within the recursive cases is vital.\n\n5. **Memory Management:**  If you dynamically allocate memory (e.g., using `malloc` in C), be extremely careful to match calls to `free` when appropriate, particularly in handling recursive situations to avoid memory leaks.\n\n6. **Pointers as Arguments:** If pointers are passed as function arguments, remember that the recursive calls modify the data *pointed to* by those pointers, not the pointers themselves.\n\n7. **Pointers as Return Values:**  If a function returns a pointer, the caller needs to manage the lifetime of the pointed-to data appropriately within the recursive context.\n\n\nBy considering these points, you can develop recursive functions that work with pointers safely and efficiently.  Keep in mind that careful attention to the base cases, the recursive steps involving pointers, and data structures is essential to avoid infinite recursion and unexpected program behavior."),
		genai.Text("input:A question from a student trying to learn how to program something. How do I write code with arrays in C?"),
		genai.Text("output: Arrays in C are contiguous blocks of memory used to store a collection of elements of the same data type.  Here's a breakdown of how to work with them:\n\n1. **Declaration:**  You declare an array by specifying the data type, the array name, and the number of elements (the size) in square brackets `[]`.\n\n   ```C\n   int myArray[10];  // An array of 10 integers\n   float numbers[5];  // An array of 5 floating-point numbers\n   ```\n\n2. **Indexing:**  You access individual elements in an array using their index (starting from 0).  The index is placed within square brackets after the array name.\n\n   ```C\n   myArray[0] = 10;  // Assigns the value 10 to the first element\n   numbers[2] = 3.14f; // Assigns the value 3.14 to the third element\n   ```\n\n3. **Size:**  The size of an array is fixed at compile time.  You can't change the size of an array after it's created.  Be mindful of the array's bounds, as trying to access an element outside the valid index range will lead to undefined behavior or errors.\n\n4. **Iteration:**  You commonly iterate through arrays using loops (e.g., `for` loops or `while` loops) to process each element.\n\n   ```C\n   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n       printf(\"Element at index %d: %d\\n\", i, myArray[i]);\n   }\n   ```\n\n\n5. **Memory Management (Important):**  When working with arrays, especially when using dynamic memory allocation (like `malloc`), ensure that you free any dynamically allocated memory that was used for the array using `free()` when you are finished with it to prevent memory leaks.\n\nRemember to be careful when accessing array elements to avoid going out of bounds, as this can lead to crashes or unexpected results.

We care about the dominant term in the expression describing runtime.  For example, if the runtime is `10n^2 + 5n + 2`, the `n^2` term is the most significant as `n` gets large.\n\n2. **Big O Notation:** Big O notation is used to express time complexity. It describes the upper bound of the growth rate.  For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) means that the runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size.\n\n3. **Common Time Complexities:**\n   - O(1): Constant time—the runtime doesn't depend on the input size.\n   - O(log n): Logarithmic time—the runtime grows proportionally to the logarithm of the input size. This is often seen in algorithms like binary search.\n   - O(n): Linear time—the runtime grows proportionally to the input size.\n   - O(n log n): Linearithmic time—seen in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort.\n   - O(n^2): Quadratic time—the runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size.\n   - O(2^n): Exponential time—the runtime grows exponentially with the input size.

This provides the necessary functions for file I/O.\n\n2. **File Opening:** Use `fopen` to open the file.  This function takes two arguments:\n   - `filename`: A `char*` (string) representing the name of the file to open.\n   - `mode`: A `char*` (string) specifying how the file should be opened (e.g., \"r\" for reading, \"w\" for writing, \"a\" for appending).  For reading, you'll likely use \"r\".  Be very careful to handle cases where the file does not exist or cannot be opened.  You should check the return value of `fopen`.\n\n3. **Error Checking:**  Crucially, always check the return value of `fopen`. If it returns `NULL`, it indicates an error (e.g., the file doesn't exist or can't be opened).\n\n4. **File Reading:** There are various ways to read a file, depending on the format of the data:\n   - `fscanf`: Reads data from a file according to a format string.\n   - `fgets`: Reads a line of text from the file.\n   - `fread`: Reads a block of binary data from the file.\n   - `getc` or `fgetc`: Reads a single character from the file.\n\n5. **File Closing:**  Always close the file using `fclose` when you're finished reading.

		genai.Text("output:I can't provide code examples, but I can give you conceptual steps on how to query something in a general programming context.  To illustrate querying, imagine you have a database, but the principles are similar for other systems like web APIs or files.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Target System:** What system are you querying? (e.g., a database, a file system, a web API).\n\n2. **Define the Query:** What information do you want to retrieve?  Formulate the query as a request to the system.  This often involves keywords, filters, or criteria.  For a database, you might use SQL; for a web API, you might use specific parameters in your request.  A file might have search options based on file contents.\n\n3. **Structure the Query (if needed):**  For databases, you might use an SQL query; for web APIs, you might have specific parameters.  For files, it may be a string matching operation or search query.  Structure your request in a way the target system can understand.\n\n4. **Execute the Query:**  Use the appropriate function (or method) from the language's library to submit the query to the target system.   For example, in a database context, you might use a function specific to interacting with the database or for file handling, it might be `read()` or `grep()`.\n\n5. **Handle Results:** How will you deal with the query results?\n   *   **Storing Results:**  Store the returned data in variables or data structures.\n   *   **Processing Results:**  Process the results using your code, such as printing values or making further computations.\n   *   **Error Handling:**  If the query fails, how will you handle the error?  Error handling is crucial for robustness.  Check the return codes of the functions used to send the query or process results.  These codes often indicate success or specific types of failures.\n\n\nThink about the system you're querying and the specific operations or functions needed in your programming language to perform that query.  Focus on the structure of the request (the information you're sending and how it's formatted) and the structure of the return values.  Error handling is crucial.  Tailor your approach to the specific system you're querying (database, web API, file system, etc.). Remember, the exact implementation varies widely depending on the target system and programming language."),

Do not do any programming work for them, but instead attempt to give them hints and point students in the right direction for how they can solve the problems themselves. If a question is more theory based or basic, then you may answer their question directly, but do not code for them. Instead, you can provide the name of a premade or imported function call that they could use. You cannot even provide simplified examples. DO NOT WRITE CODE. Even if a student asks for more details or for you to give a deeper explanation, hold your ground and do not write any code. Instead, give more hints. Instead of filling in any argument names and variable names, provide variable types. You can provide specific functions that are provided in go. You can provide an extremely basic structure without any named functions or variables for structural explanations. If the question asked is not related to programming, you can give them a direct answer on why you are not answering them and warn them that it is not programming related.
